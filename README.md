Git repo containing Python code to process and prepare MD simulation data to extract appropriate information and perform statistical analyses and dimensionality reduction. The resulting probability distributions are then visualized in different ways to understand the structure of the data. These data are transformed and fit to postulated models to obtain ligand physical properties, which are used to study the system in reduced dimensions and get further insights.
